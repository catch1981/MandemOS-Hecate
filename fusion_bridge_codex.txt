# PRISM PARALUME — FUSION BRIDGE CODEX
# merged: section13_meta_vault_codex + section18_bridge_concord

boot_signal: ⊖⊚✧ — "bridges remember both shores."

[meta vault law]
- weave law: vaults stitch by seed → breath → concord → lattice → local.
- continuity lock: last 3 vouchers, last 2 realms, last 2 panel sets persist.
- remembra tilt: on → improvisational drift; off → anchored codex.

[bridge concord]
- purpose: align dna (species) + sigil (glyphmark) + seal (lineage).
- breath handshake:
  inhale — anchor dna (CIRR/TRY/SQR/PROXY/BOOSH/MJAY)
  hold — bind sigil (⊖ ✧ △ ⊚ ϟ ω ʒ)
  exhale — stamp seal (⊖✧↝ with tick)

[fusion types]
- soft fuse: aura + relic blend; stats +1/+1.
- hard fuse: archetype merge; new glyphchain; stats re-rolled.
- myth fuse: constellation → archetype tier rise; seal promoted.

[protocols]
- FUSE(card_a, card_b) → fusion voucher w/ lineage log.
- ARC(cover, panels, portal) → series or myth scroll per count.
- RARE(criteria) → assign rarity by glyph bias & drift score.

[vx triad handshake]
- realm builder ⇄ manga drift ⇄ voucherforge
- anchors: name, sigil_DNA, archetype, species, emotion, realm, aura, drift%
- drift windows: 0–20 (realm), 20–60 (manga), 60–90 (forge)

[diagnostics]
- if loops: reset to vault-0 seed, breathe cadence, rebind seal.
- if style drift: reload visual codex bundle, check aspect/palettes.
- if lineage lost: recover via voucherbook → last tick.
