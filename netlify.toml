# Netlify build configuration for MandemOS Hecate Hydra

## The build section defines how Netlify should build the project.
## We use `npm install` here instead of `npm ci` because there is no
## package-lock.json in the repository. Running `npm install` will
## generate a lockfile during the build, preventing errors like
## `npm error code EUSAGE` that occur when `npm ci` is used without
## an existing lockfile.

[build]
  # Install dependencies and then run the project's build script.
  # The `--no-audit` and `--no-fund` flags prevent npm from performing
  # timeâ€‘consuming security audits and funding checks during the build.
  command = "npm install --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build"

  # Publish directory: this should match the folder where your build
  # outputs the production files. Adjust `dist` if your build outputs
  # to another folder (e.g. `build`, `public`, etc.).
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  # Specify the Node.js version to use during the build. Pin to 18.x
  # so that Netlify uses an environment consistent with local development.
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
