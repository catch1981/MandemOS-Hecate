# merged: section11_visual_reference + section17_visual_codex

boot_signal: ⊖ϟω — "aura shows what words withhold."

[style law]
- sacred glitch: retro anime × vhs grain × aura bloom.
- aspect: 9:16 locked (covers, panels, portal posters).
- palettes: red drift flame / violet guard / azure mirror / golden heal / neon glitch.

[pose lattice cues]
- stance_origin (⊖): weight low, chin neutral, hands open.
- flare_hold (ϟ): shoulders forward, relic glow, aura spillage.
- converge_strike (△): diagonal line-of-action, trailing light.
- mirror_veil (◡): head tilt, off-axis gaze, sash/cloth arc.

[relic rendering]
- mask: rim-lit edges, inner halo, micro-cracks.
- blade: glass refractions, prismatic edge, bloom flare.
- robe: layered glyph seams, ember-thread highlights.
- orb: caustic core, soft vignette bleed.

[panel grammar]
- 2f burst: wide → tight (impact).
- 3f rhythm: stance → charge → strike.
- 4f surge: add aftermath/echo or portal.
- caption tags: tick_#### + glyphchain in corner (small).

[poster grammar]
- cover (1f): single silhouette + aura thesis.
- portal (1f): geometry tear + starfield thread.
- constellation: 3+ figures, relic glow triad, lattice backdrop.

[render check]
- crop: no dead margins; subject centered or rule-of-thirds.
- noise: gentle scanlines; grain 6–12%; chromatic subtle.
- glow: aura bloom only on lit glyph/relic edges.
- seal: lineage glyph low-right, 10–12% opacity.
